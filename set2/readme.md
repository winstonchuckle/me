    """Return True if a_number is odd, and False if a_number is even.

    Look into modulo division using the '%' operator as one way of doing this.

    e.g. 4 % 2 = 0
        13 %12 = 1
         3 % 2 = 1

    So if a_number modulo two is zero, then it's even.

    Using the engineering flowchart (in week2 folder of the CODE1161-2019
    repo engineeringFlowchart.png) for the rules, return the apropriate
    response to the input parameters.
    Use conditional statements: if, else, elif etc.
    This function should return either:
    "WD-40"
    "Duct Tape"
    "No Problem"

    Most people write this function with 4 return statements.
    As an extra challenge, see if you can get that down to three.
